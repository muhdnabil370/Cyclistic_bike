# Cyclistic_bike

### Project Overview

In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share program, which has since expanded to a fleet of 5,824 geotracked bicycles across 692 stations in Chicago. These bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other at any time. Cyclistic’s marketing strategy has focused on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments, aided by flexible pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Casual riders purchase single-ride or full-day passes, while annual memberships are bought by Cyclistic members.

Cyclistic’s finance analysts have determined that annual members are significantly more profitable than casual riders. Although flexible pricing attracts more customers, Moreno believes that increasing the number of annual members is crucial for future growth. Instead of targeting entirely new customers, Moreno sees an opportunity to convert casual riders into members, as they are already familiar with the Cyclistic program and use it for their mobility needs.

To achieve this, Moreno has set a clear goal: create marketing strategies to convert casual riders into annual members. To do so, the team must understand the differences between annual members and casual riders, the motivations behind casual riders purchasing memberships, and how digital media could enhance their marketing efforts. Moreno and her team plan to analyze Cyclistic's historical bike trip data to identify trends and inform their strategies.

### Objective
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
